MultiWfn is a very useful program for wavefunction analysis. You will need a .wfn or .wfx file that is computed by your electronic structure calculation software (e.g. I am using gaussian to compute this file) and the MultiWfn software can help you extract various information that could be usefull for your analyses. In this tutorial we will cover how to plot the Non-Covalent Interactions (NCI) as well as the critical bond points and paths that are present in our molecule, using the Atoms In Molecules (AIM) theory. MultiWfn has a very complete manual that can be accessed [here](http://sobereva.com/multiwfn/misc/Multiwfn_3.8_dev.pdf) and a very informative YouTube channel with lots of video tutorials that can be accessed [here](https://www.youtube.com/@sobereva). I created this tutorial just to combine in an easy way two of the analyses that I usually do in my researchm without having to search thrpugh the whole manual or watch the youtube videos everytime, but please have a look at the original sources for further information!

### Just a bit of Theory first ###


**Plot NCI**

1. Open Multiwfn and drag and drop your .wfn file.   
2.
