In our previous [tutorial](https://sofki.github.io/2025-12-01-MDtutorial/), we saw step by step how one can externally parametrize a ligand and build a protein-ligand system topology for MD simulations with Gromacs. However, this method, although simple, can be quite tedious, especially if you have to parametrize a large number of systems with different ligands. Luckily, a python package called [Gromologist](https://gitlab.com/KomBioMol/gromologist) can automize a lot of the process and make it less prone to human error. The package has a lot of utilities, that will not be covered in this tutorial. For its full capability, visit their [tutorials](https://gitlab.com/KomBioMol/gromologist/-/wikis/Tutorials) website!
