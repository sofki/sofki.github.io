Building a complex system containing a protein (especially a metalloprotein) that contains small molecules that act aaas co-factors and a docked ligand can eb a very challenging procedure. In order to make things easier a created this tutorial using only free and open access resources, such as [Antechamber](https://ambermd.org/antechamber/ac.html), [acpype](https://alanwilter.github.io/acpype/) and [GROMACS](https://www.gromacs.org/).

This tutorial aspires to help each user that has to perform this difficult task in the future and therefore serve the community as a free educational resource. Nonetheless, it serves an additional role. It can be referenced as a public protocol for the system preparations of the short MD simulations that followed the docking of p-cymene into each target protein to assess the stability of the protein-ligand complex, for the **MSCA**-funded project [**_Waste2Drug_**](https://sofki.github.io/waste-2-drug/). In this way, the reproducibility of the results and the [Open Science](https://rea.ec.europa.eu/open-science_en) principles of the project is ensured.
