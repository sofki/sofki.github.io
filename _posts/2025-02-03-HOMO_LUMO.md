MultiWfn is a very useful program for wavefunction analysis. You can use a .wfn or .wfx wavefunction file for plotting any occupied orbital, but for a more accurate LUMO (and any LUMO +n) the formatted checkpoint file is needed. I use Gaussian 16 for its generation.

MultiWfn has a very complete manual that can be accessed [here](http://sobereva.com/multiwfn/misc/Multiwfn_3.8_dev.pdf) and a very informative YouTube channel with lots of video tutorials that can be accessed [here](https://www.youtube.com/@sobereva). 

I created this tutorial for my (and everyone's) easy future reference because sometime's it is kind of difficult to find the correct tutorial online or even browse through the manual!

**Plot LUMO**

1. Open Multiwfn and drag and drop your .fchk file.   
2. Write **200** from the main functions menu: *Other functions (part 2)*
3. Then choose the subfunction **3**: *Generate cube file for multiple orbital wavefunctions *
4.Choose la for the alpha LUMO orbital.
5. Choose the high quality grid by writing **3** (if your computer is slow, opt for a lower quality grid). A la.cub file is written.
6. Copy the showcub.vmd file from the MultiWfn examples/scripts folder to your VMD folder.
9. Open VMD and run the script by writing at VMDâ€™s black console screen        
          ```
           source showcub.vmd
          ```
10. Then wirte cub la in your console. The alpha LUMO orbital will appear in your VMD window.
