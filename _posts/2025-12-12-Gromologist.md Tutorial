In our previous [tutorial](https://sofki.github.io/2025-12-01-MDtutorial/), we saw step by step how one can externally parametrize a ligand and build a protein-ligand system topology for MD simulations with Gromacs. However, this method, although simple, can be quite tedious, especially if you have to parametrize alarge number of systems with different ligands.
