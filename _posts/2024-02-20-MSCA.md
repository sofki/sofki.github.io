**Excited to share some incredible news!**

I am thrilled and deeply honored to announce that I have been awarded the prestigious European Research Area (ERA) Postdoctoral Fellowship under Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions with the **_Waste2Drug_** project! This is a significant milestone in my academic and research journey, and I am incredibly grateful for this recognition.

This fellowship opens up new avenues for exploration and collaboration, allowing me to delve deeper into cutting-edge research in _waste valorisation_ and novel _drug design_. I am excited about the opportunities ahead to contribute to the advancement of knowledge and innovation in this field.

Receiving the **MSCA ERA Fellowship** is not just a personal achievement, but a testament to the hard work, dedication, and support of my mentors, colleagues, and collaborators who have guided and inspired me along the way. 

I look forward to the exciting challenges and discoveries that lie ahead and am eager to embark on this transformative journey at _NovaMechanics Ltd_ with _Dr. Antreas Afantitis_. While I am immensly excited to start on the new project, due to being currently engaged in another competitive fellowship from the _Xunta de Galicia_, I will be commencing the project at a later date. This overlap presents a unique opportunity for me to leverage insights and experiences from both fellowships, enriching my research endeavors and contributing to the advancement of knowledge using computational chemistry in a multidisciplinary approach. 

I'm eager to bring fresh perspectives and innovative ideas to the table when I fully begin the **Marie Curie ERA Fellowship**.
