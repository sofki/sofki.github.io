### Mechanistic Studies on Catalysis
We use computational quantum methodology in order to study in depth the underlying mechanisms that govern catalytic reactions. We study complex phenomena related to transition metal reactivity, such as two-state reactivity and spin-state crossings, as well as redox chemistry. We are particularly interested in OAT reactions catalyzed by metals in low-oxidation states and in gold and nickel homogeneous catalysis.

### Catalyst Optimization using Machine Learning
We implement ML algorithms combined with computational quantum chemistry and experimental studies, in order to optimize catalytic reactions.
