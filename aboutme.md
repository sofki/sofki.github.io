I am a Theoretical and Computational Chemist with a passion for reaction mechanisms and TS hunting. I currently work on catalysis but I have extensive experience in simulating systems of biological interest (proteins, drug molecules and cellular membranes). My computational techniques span from all atom Molecular Dynamics to Density Functional Theory. I am eager to implement AI/ML in my research.

### My story

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
