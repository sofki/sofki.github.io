title: About me
subtitle: Transition states are my unicorn
---

I am a _Theoretical and Computational Chemist_ with a passion for reaction mechanisms and transition state hunting. I currently work on catalysis but I have extensive experience in simulating systems of biological interest (proteins, drug molecules and cellular membranes).  
My computational techniques span from all atom Molecular Dynamics to Density Functional Theory. I can program in python and I am eager to implement AI/ML in my research.  
My **areas of specialization** include _Reactivity_, _Catalysis_, _DFT_, _Biomolecular Simulations_, _Molecular Dynamics_ and _Drug Design_.  
**I am interested in** _Science Communication_, _Graphic Design_, _Acrobatics_, _cooking_ and learning new _languages_.  
I am fluent in greek, english and spanish, I have some basic knowledge of swedish and french and I am currently learning italian!
