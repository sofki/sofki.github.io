title: About me
subtitle: Transition states are my unicorn
---

I am a _Theoretical and Computational Chemist_ with a passion for drug design, reaction mechanisms and transition state hunting. I currently work on my **MSCA Postdoctoral Fellowships** project, *Waste2Drug* where I try to combine all these passions in an attempt to valorise agricultural waste for the development of novel anticancer drugs in a circular bioeconomy scheme. I have recently worked on catalysis but I have extensive experience in simulating systems of biological interest (proteins, drug molecules and cellular membranes). My computational techniques span from all atom Molecular Dynamics to Density Functional Theory. I can program in python and I am eager to implement AI/ML in my research.  

My **areas of specialization** include _Reactivity_, _Catalysis_, _DFT_, _Biomolecular Simulations_, _Molecular Docking_, _Molecular Dynamics_ and _Drug Design_.  
**I am interested in** _science communication_, _graphic design_, _acrobatics_, _cooking_ and learning new _languages_.  
I am fluent in _greek_, _english_ and _spanish_, manage in _italian_ and have some basic knowledge of _swedish_ and _french_!

**I advocate for** _labour rights_ and _gender equality_ in science.
